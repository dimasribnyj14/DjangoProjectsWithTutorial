# DjangoProjectsWithTutorial
Hello, this repository was created to firstly learn how to write django and secondly to make programming tutorial sites.

It will be useful for me and for you.

There will be python and javascript in the main, but there will be other topics as well.

I started this repository with the topic localStorage because that was our last assignment from the teacher so far.

I do many but small Django projects so that I don't get confused myself and so that you don't get confused yourself.

You go to the repository to select a specific theme.

Okay, I'm going, come on, bye!
